# SOM_ACP
Self organizing map with principal component analysis

In this work we try to develop a system for pattern classification and recognition,
this work is based on artificial neural networks and mathematical method of data
analysis ACP to develop a software model that works in two modes, classic mode uses
classical algorithm known and enhanced mode that combines both ACP algorithm
and the learning algorithm of the SOM map.
